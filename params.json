BCIs more and more become a promenent topic in research and media. It is known, that the BCI research field is a multidisciplinary one, involving e.g., psychology, medicine and biomedical engeneering. Unfortunately, due to such a multidisciplinarity, exchangeable tools and methods are rare.\r\ntool4BCI mainly relies on the work from Mason and Birch (2003) - \"[A general framework for brain-computer interaction design](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1200910)\" . In this work, the BCI is divided into distinct modules, connected with individual interfaces.\r\ntools4BCI can be seen as a starting point to provide implementations for those interfaces and establish some common ground for the standardization of BCI processes.\r\nThe defined and implemented interfaces focus mainly on brain-computer interface systems, but might be useful for various other research fields, e.g., neuroscience in general or other biosignal processing fields.\r\n\r\ntools4BCI is mainly developed by the [Institute for Neural Engineering](http://bci.tugraz.at), [Graz University of Technology](http://portal.tugraz.at/portal/page/portal/TU_Graz) and [Defitech Chair in Brain-Machine Interface](http://cnbi.epfl.ch) at [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch) and was created within the European FP7 Project [TOBI](http://www.tobi-project.org/) (Tools for Brain-Computer Interaction). \r\n\r\n### The Core\r\nThe tobicore library package provides a set of libraries for transmitting classification results via TiC and to deliver events via TiD. \r\n\r\n### Features\r\nThe tobicore project provides a total of five C++ libraries that implement some concepts of the TOBI hBCI design\r\n\r\n* libtobicore:\r\n    This is low-level library that provides basic functionalities, such as timestamp management (via TCTimestamp) and the TCBlock base class.\r\n    It an essential library for all other libraries within the tobicore package.\r\n* libtobiic:\r\n    This library implements the TOBI iC classifier output encoding/decoding via ICMessage.\r\n* libtobiid:\r\n    This library implements the TOBI iD events encoding/decoding via IDMessage.\r\n* libtobiplatform:\r\n    This library provides working and cross-platform implementations of some TOBI components,\r\n    such as an iC client/server class (TPiC) and an iD client class (TPiD).\r\n    (under Windows, e.g. MinGW or Cygwin are needed to compile this library.)\r\n* libTiD:\r\n    This library provides a platform independent network layer around the tobiid library including a TiD server to dispatch TiD messages.\r\n\r\n*  tobicoremat:\r\n    This library provides MEX interfaces to a large set of the tobicore functionalities. The MEX interfaces are not documented here since a per-funtion documentation is provided in the .m files and examples are provided with the interfaces.\r\n\r\n### Code\r\nThe tobicore library is written in C++ and the Code is available [here](https://github.com/tools4BCI/core).\r\nTo get r/w access to the tobicore repository, please get in touch with: Christian Breitwieser -- c.breitwieser(at)tugraz(dot)at\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n* Doxygen doku\r\n* Documents illustrating the general concepts of tobiic and tobiid are additionally available:\r\n  * tobiic description\r\n  * tobiid description\r\n\r\n### Licencing\r\nThe individual tobicore libraries are licenced under the [LGPL version 3.0](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html).",
