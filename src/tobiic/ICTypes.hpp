/*! \mainpage tobicore
 *
 * \section sec_intro Introduction
 * The tobicore project provides a total of four C++ libraries that implement
 * some concepts of the <a href="http://www.tobi-project.org">TOBI</a> hBCI design.
 *
 * \subsection sec_intro1 libtobicore 
 * Low-level library that provides basic functionalities, such as timestamp
 * management (via TCTimestamp) and the TCBlock base class. 
 *
 * \subsection sec_intro2 libtobiic 
 * Implements the TOBI iC classifier output encoding/decoding via ICMessage.
 *
 * \subsection sec_intro3 libtobiid 
 * Implements the TOBI iD events encoding/decoding via IDMessage.
 *
 * \subsection sec_intro4 libtobiplatform
 * Provides working and cross-platform implementations of some TOBI components,
 * such as an iC client/server class (TPiC) and an iD client class (TPiD).
 * 
 * \subsection sec_intro5 tobicoremat: mextobicore, mextobiic and mextobiid
 * tobicoremat provides MEX interfaces to a large set of the tobicore
 * functionalities. The MEX interfaces are not documented here since a
 * per-funtion documentation is provided in the .m files and examples are
 * provided with the interfaces.
 *
 * \section sec_resources Resources
 * - <a href="http://www.tobi-project.org">TOBI project website</a>: general
 * resources about the big BCI project responsible about the hBCI design 
 * - <a href="http://www..org">BCI standards website</a>: lots of information
 * about hBCI and BCI standards in general
 * - <a href="http://files.mtvl.org/projects/tobicore/doc/libtobiic.pdf">TOBI iC
 * for dummies</a>: this guide was written to make sure non-technical people
 * could understand the basis of TOBI iC. Do not expect design documents and
 * other boring stuff. You will mainly find user-cases and examples there.
 * Still, it is a must-read document before starting.
 * - <a href="http://files.mtvl.org/projects/tobicore/doc/libtobiid.pdf">TOBI iD
 * for dummies</a>: as before.
 *
 * \section sec_install Compile and install
 * The tobicore libraries and tools are available on multiple platforms, and the
 * author provides ready-to-use packages. The rule of thumb is:
 * - Ubuntu and Debian Linux 32bit/64bit are always supported via .deb packages
 * - Windows support is limited to 32 bit and, as today, only for Windows 7
 * - No package is provided for other platforms
 * - GNU automake and autoconf make it easy to build the libraries on other
 * platforms
 * Some videos are available and provide an overall introduction to the
 * tobicore technicalities.
 *
 * \subsection sec_install_requirments Requirements
 * In order to build tobicore you need:
 * - automake, autoconf, libtool, gcc
 * - Mathworks Matlab for the MEX interfaces
 * - <a href="http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~dbindel/mwrap/">mwap</a>
 *
 * To compile for Microsoft Windows, you also need:
 * - MinGW + Msys: I suggest you download the "mingw-get-install" installer and
 * install the latest official package list. 
 * - <a href="http://gnumex.sourceforge.net">Gnumex</a>
 *
 * \subsection sec_install_linux Linux
 * <PRE>
 * autoreconf -i
 * mkdir build
 * cd build
 * ../configure
 * make
 * make install # to install
 * make check   # to build the examples
 * make html    # to build the documentation
 * </PRE>
 * 
 * \subsection sec_install_mingw MinGW
 * <PRE>
 * autoreconf -i
 * mkdir build
 * cd build
 * ../configure --prefix=/mingw/
 * make
 * make install # to install
 * make check   # to build the examples
 * make html    # to build the documentation
 * </PRE>
 *
 * \subsection sec_install_linux_deb Debian packages
 * <PRE>
 * dpkg -i libtobicore*.deb
 * </PRE>
 *
 * \section sev_version Versioning
 * tobicore versions follow the $CURRENT.$REVISION.$AGE schema and the following
 * rules:
 * - If the library source code has changed at all since the last update,
 * then increment $REVISION
 * - If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the last
 * update, increment $CURRENT, and set $REVISION to 0
 * - If any interfaces have been added since the last public release, then
 * increment $AGE
 * - If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release, then
 * set $AGE to 0
 *
 * \section sec_author Author
 * tobicore is written, documented and maintained by Michele Tavella
 * <michele.tavella@epfl.ch>.
